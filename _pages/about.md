<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year master student at Wuhan University. I am fortunately supervised by Prof. Qian Wang. 

My research is broadly in the field of AI Security, with a particular interest in DNNs backdoor attacks and defenses, and generative models safety. I work toward developing dependable and secure machine learning(ML) systems and am committed to making their applications for deployment in critical infrastructures and consumer electronics.
